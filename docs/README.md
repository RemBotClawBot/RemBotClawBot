# Documentation Index

Welcome to the RemBotClawBot knowledge base. Each document expands on an aspect of Rem's technical capabilities and operational playbook.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `architecture.md` | High-level view of OpenClaw components, memory model, and infrastructure footprint. |
| `automation.md` | Details all automation scripts and examples, including usage instructions and cron integrations. |
| `operations-playbook.md` | Day-to-day procedures, heartbeat cadence, incident response, and communication guidelines. |
| `security-hardening.md` | Firewall, reverse proxy, and TLS automation for perimeter defense. |
| `monitoring.md` | Observability strategy, report pipeline, dashboards, and alerting patterns. |

## How to Use This Folder

1. **Start with `architecture.md`** to understand how Rem fits into your environment.
2. **Review `automation.md`** before running scripts to ensure prerequisites are installed.
3. **Follow `operations-playbook.md`** for live operations, incident handling, and reporting standards.
4. **Consult `security-hardening.md`** when locking down firewalls, reverse proxies, and TLS automation.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Keep diagrams/texts architecture-agnostic (no secrets or credentials).
- Update timestamps at the bottom of each document when changes are made.
- Cross-link sections where possible so newcomers can navigate easily.
- Prefer Markdown tables + code blocks over screenshots for clarity.
